Files are where most of the design and collaboration process takes place in Figma. Learn more about file structure, permissions, and format in our [Files in Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039830954) article.

# Search for files

Files are just one of the things you can search for in Figma. Find the search bar in the top-left corner of your File Browser.

# View and sort files

You can choose how you want to view files in the File Browser. In the top-right corner of the File Browser, use the grid and list icons to switch between views.

## List view

List view is a pared back view, which lets you see some basic information about each file. This allows you to quickly find files based on their name and the date they were _Last modified._

1.  See the File name
2.  View a miniature file thumbnail
3.  View the date Last modified
4.  View the date Created

## Grid view (default)

In grid view, the [file thumbnail](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038511413) takes center stage, which makes it easier for you to quickly identify a file by its contents. This is the default view in the File Browser.

You'll have access to more contextual information in grid view:

![Annotated_grid_view.png](https://cdn.coiven.com/static/doc/Annotated%20grid%20view.png)

1.  View the File Thumbnail: [Set a Custom Thumbnail](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038511413)
2.  View the File Name
3.  View the **Date** and **Time** you last **_viewed_** or **_edited_** the File.
4.  If anyone is currently viewing the File, you will see their Profile Picture there.
5.  If you're viewing a File in the _Recents_ File Space, you can see which Project the File is in.

## Sort files

Choose how to order files in your Drafts, Recents, or projects. Or, in your search results.

1.  Open your Drafts, Recents, or a Project Page in the File Browser.
2.  Click the arrow next to the current sort.
3.  Select the desired sort order from the options. Choose from:
    *   **File Name**
    *   **Date Created**
    *   **Last Modified**
    *   _Last Viewed_ (Recent Files only)
    *   _Date Deleted_ (Deleted Files)
    *   _Search Relevance_ (when Searching for Files)
4.  We will then sort your Files in the order you selected.

>**Note:** If you are in **List** view, you only have the option to sort by **Last Modified**.
