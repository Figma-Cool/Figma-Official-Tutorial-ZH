>Anyone can move files from their Drafts. You must be an Editor on the project to move a file to another team or project.

Move files between **Drafts**, **projects,** and **teams** to change its location. You can move files from the Editor, or in the File Browser.

>**Note**: If you are the Owner of the file or team you will need to transfer ownership of the file first. This makes sure the files aren't lost for other collaborators when you leave the team or delete the files.

*   [Change the Owner of a team](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039481134)

# Move files in the Editor

In the Editor, you can:

*   Move a file from your Drafts to a team
*   Move a file to a different project 
*   Move a file to a project in a different team
*   Create a new project and move a file into it

>**Note**: If you move a File outside of a team, team members may no longer be able to access it. Only team members who are listed on the file sharing modal will still have access.

1.  Click on an empty spot in the Canvas. This will deselect any layers.
2.  Click the File name in the Toolbar and select **Move to Project**:
3.  Choose which project to move it to. 
    1.  Search for the team or project using the field provided.
    2.  Choose an existing project within another team. Only [favorited projects](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038511513) will appear in the window.
    3.  Create a **\+ New Project** in a team
4.  Click **Move** to confirm.

# Move files in the File Browser

In the File Browser, you can move files between your Drafts and any projects within a team. 

Only [favorited projects](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038511513) show in the File Browser. It's not possible to move a file into just a team, or into a project that you haven't favorited.

1.  Choose which file(s) you want to move
    *   Select a single file to move
    *   Hold Shift to select more than one file
    *   Click and drag to select multiple files
2.  Drag your selection over the new location in the File Browser. Figma will highlight the project you are moving it to.
3.  Release to move the file.

Note: It's not possible to move files between [Personal Space and Organization Space](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039819074). One way to move files into an Organization is to [export them](#Export-the-file).

# Move files between accounts

If you're deleting an old team or handing over files, you may want to move a File to another account.

There are two different ways you can move a file between Figma accounts.

## Share the file

*   [Invite the other account as an Editor](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040530313) to the File using the correct email address.
*   If the File(s) are in another team, you can move them to a new team and [invite the other account to that team](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039481034).

## Export the file

You can also export your files as .fig files. This allows you to upload the file to another Figma account.

We will treat this as a new file and won't copy across any [Permissions](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039970673), [Comments](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039825314) or [Version History](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038006754).

When you import the file again, we will also treat Components as new Master Components. Instances are no longer linked to the original file and won't receive any updates.

1.  Open the file you want to export.
2.  Go to the main menu
    
3.  Go to **File > Save as .fig**. Figma will download a copy of the file to [your downloads folder](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040521373).
4.  Open the Figma Account you want to move it to.
5.  Import the **.fig** file by [dragging the file into Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041003114).

>**Tip**! Create a duplicate by adding& `/duplicate` to the end of the file URL. Then you can open the URL in your other Figma account. Figma treats this as a new file, so it doesn't include the existing Permissions, Comments or Version History.
