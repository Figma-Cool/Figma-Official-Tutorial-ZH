If you're working across multiple design tools, then you may wish to export or copy across objects, groups or entire Frames into another system.

Exporting and importing Vectors often requires conversion. Depending on the quality of the exporter/importer, this can often be a lossy process.

As SVG is a _lossless_ format, **we recommend SVG** files when moving between design tools.

# Import to Figma

You can import SVG elements from other design tools by copying them and pasting them in Figma. This allows you to bring across icons and graphics, as well as layers, groups or entire artboards.

1.  Open the tool you want to select your layers from.
2.  Select the elements you want to copy.
3.  Copy the elements to your clipboard:
    *   In **Illustrator**, select "Copy"
    *   In **Sketch**, select "Copy as SVG"
    *   In **Figma**, select "Copy"
    *   In **Adobe XD**, go to "_File > Export > Export to SVG"_
4.  Open the Figma File in the Editor.
5.  Paste the layers or SVGs into the Canvas.

>**Note:** SVG Symbol, marker and clipPath elements are not currently imported.

# Export from Figma

You can drag SVG files exported from Figma directly into both _Sketch_ and _Illustrator_.

For _Adobe XD_ and _Affinity Design_ users, use the **Copy as SVG** option in Figma to copy the layer or group, then **Paste** the SVG directly in the other tool.

You can also export your Files from Figma to other tools in your workflow via our purpose-built integrations:
