You can import entire design files from **Sketch** (.sketch) into Figma. This will create a new Figma file from your Sketch import. 

Any further changes you make to the original file in Sketch will not be reflected in Figma if you re-import the file, and vice versa.

# Supported Sketch Features

Figma supports and converts the following Sketch features:

1.  [Pages](#pages)
2.  [Symbols](#symbols)
3.  [Fonts](#fonts)
4.  [Styles](#styles)

## Pages

Like Sketch, you can store multiple Pages within a single Figma File. Any pages that exist in your Sketch files will be imported as separate pages within the Figma File.

You can switch between Pages from the Layers Panel on the left-hand side of the Editor. Learn more about viewing Pages in our [Layers Panel](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039831974) article.

## Symbols

When you import your Sketch files into Figma, any "Symbols" included in the Sketch file will be converted to Figma Components. The Symbols page in the Sketch file will be imported into Figma as a page named **_Symbols_** that contains your Master Components.

If you're on the Figma Professional plan, these [Components](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654) can then be published to your Team Library. This allows you to reuse those elements across multiple designs.

**Note:** Sketch Symbol Libraries will be imported as a Figma File, and not as a Team Library. You may need to publish the Master Components to your Team Library after importing.

## Fonts

If you have been using custom or locally stored Fonts in Sketch, these can also be supported in Figma. To make sure Text objects are imported correctly from Sketch, you need to ensure those Fonts have been made available to you in Figma.

*   If you are using the Figma Desktop app, you will be able to access any local fonts by default. You won't need to do anything further.
*   If you're using Figma in the browser, then you will need to download the **Figma Font Helper** to use any locally available fonts. 

You will still be able to import Sketch files, but text objects may not be imported correctly. If this occurs, you will receive a "Missing Fonts" message in Figma. This will give you the opportunity to update any affected Text objects to another Font.

Learn more about using [Local Fonts](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956894) and [managing Missing Fonts](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956994).

Using local fonts is not currently supported for Professional Teams using Linux or ChromeOS.  _Linux and ChromeOS users can leverage Figma Organization, our enterprise tier, to access Shared Fonts within an Organization. Learn more about [Figma Organization](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001980773-Administration#Manage-an-Organization)._ 

## Styles

Styles will not be added via the import process. Any Styles you have been using in Sketch will need to be created as Styles in Figma. Check out our [Creating Styles](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957034) article for more information on creating and adding Styles.

**Features not supported:** If you are seeing error in the console log regarding unsupported features or properties, then it may mean you are using an outdated version of Sketch. We recommend updating to the latest version of Sketch before saving the file and re-importing into Figma.

# Import a Sketch file

There are a few ways you can import your designs from Sketch:

*   Use the **File Importer** in the File Browser
*   **Drag and drop** .sketch files into the File Browser
*   [Create a new File from a Sketch File](#New-from-Sketch-File)
*   [Copy and paste Artboards or layers](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040030374) from Sketch.

## New from Sketch File

When you are in the Editor, you can create a new File from a Sketch file.

1.  Click on the menu icon in the top-left corner of Figma.
2.  Go to **File > New from Sketch File**:

3.  Select a .sketch file and click **Open** to import.

**Sketch beta:** If you are using a beta version of Sketch, particularly a version that has been updated recently, there may be discrepancies with how we handle things behind the scenes. We aim to respond to changes as soon as possible, but let us know if you're having any trouble importing files from a Sketch beta version.

If you are still having issues importing files, we'd love to help! Contact the Support team by clicking the "?" icon in the bottom-right corner of the Figma app and selecting "Get Help". Or, send an email to [support@figma.com](mailto:support@figma.com).

To allow us to troubleshoot any issues faster, please include:

*   Screenshots of any error messages
*   The output of any errors in the Console log.
*   We may also need access to the original file to troubleshoot further.
