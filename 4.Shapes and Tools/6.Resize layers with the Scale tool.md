By default, files open with the Move Tool enabled. Click the drop down icon (or use the "K" shortcut) and you'll find the Scale tool.

While you can't scale numerically, you can drag out the handles of the bounding box and the content inside will scale. 

Scaling works for:

*   Frames
*   Groups
*   Components
*   Component Instances
*   Text objects

Any blurs and strokes will scale as well.
