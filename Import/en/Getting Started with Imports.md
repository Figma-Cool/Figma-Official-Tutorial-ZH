Getting Started with Imports
============================

**Before you Start, Who can use this feature**

Users on Any [plan](https://help.figma.com/article/209-understanding-figmas-plans) can import Files

Users with Edit access can import Files to a team. Anyone can import Files to their Drafts.

Users with Edit access can import image or vector files into a File

----

Moving files between tools doesn't need to be painful. You can import a range of different file types into Figma.

This includes entire design files from Sketch or Figma, as well as individual Image and Vector files.

There are many different ways to import Files into Figma. The best method will depend on what type of File you are wanting to import.

I want to import:

- [Getting Started with Imports](#getting-started-with-imports)
- [Import images](#import-images)
- [Import vectors](#import-vectors)
- [Import entire design files](#import-entire-design-files)

The table below details which methods are supported for each File type.

Import images
=============

There are many ways you can add images to Figma.

*   [Drag and drop](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040028034) images onto the Canvas
*   [Import files](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041003114) via the File Browser
*   [Upload an Image as a fill](https://www.notion.so/hc/en-us/articles/360041090073)
*   [Paste images from your clipboard](https://www.notion.so/hc/en-us/articles/360040615014)
*   [Copy and paste images between objects](https://www.notion.so/hc/en-us/articles/360040615014)

Import vectors
==============

Exporting and importing Vectors often requires conversion. Depending on the quality of the exporter/importer, this can often be a lossy process.

As SVG is a _lossless_ format, **we recommend exporting SVG files**.

You can import vectors via a couple of different methods:

*   Importing entire Sketch or Figma Files that contain vectors.
*   Copying layers in other design tools and pasting them in Figma.
*   Exporting vectors as SVGs and importing them into Figma.

Learn more about importing and exporting vectors in our [Copy assets between design tools](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040030374) article.

Import entire design files
==========================

There are a couple of ways you can import entire design files into Figma.

*   Import .sketch and .fig files using the File Import
*   Drag and drop files into Figma

Learn more in our [Import files into Figma](https://help.figma.com/tbc) article.

**Note:** If you are working with large file sizes, especially files with multiple pages and lots of images, then you may encounter issues importing these into Figma.

Files still loading or images can't be viewed? We recommend breaking up the original file into smaller files before you try to import again.

**Missing fonts?** If you're using Figma in the browser then you will need to download the Figma Font Helper to access any locally available fonts.

The Figma Desktop app will already have access to local fonts by default. Learn more about managing missing fonts in our [Manage missing fonts](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956994) article.
