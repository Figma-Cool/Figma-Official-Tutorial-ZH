Moving files between tools doesn't need to be painful. You can import a range of different file types into Figma.

This includes entire design files from Sketch or Figma, as well as individual Image and Vector files.

There are many different ways to import Files into Figma. The best method will depend on what type of File you are wanting to import.

我要导入：

- [Import images](#import-images)
- [Import vectors](#import-vectors)
- [导入整个设计文件](#import-entire-design-files)

下表详细列出了每种文件类型支持哪些方法。

# Import vectors

Exporting and importing Vectors often requires conversion. Depending on the quality of the exporter/importer, this can often be a lossy process.

As SVG is a *lossless* format, **we recommend exporting SVG files**.

You can import vectors via a couple of different methods:

- Importing entire Sketch or Figma Files that contain vectors.
- Copying layers in other design tools and pasting them in Figma.
- Exporting vectors as SVGs and importing them into Figma.

Learn more about importing and exporting vectors in our [Copy assets between design tools](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040030374) article.

# 导入整个设计文件

There are a couple of ways you can import entire design files into Figma.

- Import .sketch and .fig files using the File Import
- Drag and drop files into Figma

Learn more in our [Import files into Figma](https://help.figma.com/tbc) article.

> **Note:** If you are working with large file sizes, especially >files with multiple pages and lots of images, then you may encounter issues importing these into Figma.
> Files still loading or images can't be viewed? We recommend >breaking up the original file into smaller files before you try to >import again.

> **Missing fonts?** If you're using Figma in the browser then you >will need to download the Figma Font Helper to access any locally >available fonts.
> The Figma Desktop app will already have access to local fonts by >default. Learn more about managing missing fonts in our [Manage >missing fonts](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956994) article.
