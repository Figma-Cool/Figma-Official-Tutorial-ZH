# Getting started with text

Text is one of the crucial components of interface design. It can help determine the legibility and appeal of your design.

Your decisions around text can impact how successfully you convey your message. Everything from the placement and arrangement of text, to the choice of font, has a part to play.

## Figma's text rendering

There can often be a difference in how browsers and operating systems render text. This can make designing across systems and platforms unpredictable.

**Figma uses its own custom text rendering.**Â This ensures your designs look consistent, regardless of your browser or operating system.
