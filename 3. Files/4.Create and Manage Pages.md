Within a File, you can create as many **Pages** as you need.

Each Page has its own Canvas, where you can explore and iterate on your designs. You can even create separate [Prototypes](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193) on each Page.

You can access **Pages** when you open a File in the **Editor**.

You can find, view and navigate between Pages at the top of the left-side panel ( [Layers Panel](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039831974)). 

To open the Page list, click on the arrow next to the current Page name:

# Add a Page

You can create a [New Page](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038511293) from scratch, or [Duplicate](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038511533) an existing one.

## Create a New Page

1.  Click the **+** icon to add a new Page to your File: ![](https://cdn.coiven.com/static/doc/file-mbkMXxQw5L.png)
2.  Give your new Page a name.

## Duplicate an Existing Page

This is super handy if you want to create a snapshot of your current work. Or, when building different Prototype flows out of the same designs.

1.  Find the Page you want to copy in the Page list.
2.  Right-click on the Page and select **Duplicate ![](https://cdn.coiven.com/static/doc/file-StdIFGmfe5.png)** 
3.  We'll add a copy of that Page to the File with the name **Copy of.**
4.  Right-click on the Page and select **Rename** to change the Page name.

# Rename a Page

There are two ways to rename a Page:

*   Right-click on the Page and select **Rename**
*   Double-click on the Page name

2.  Right-click on the Page and select **Delete.**

# Reorder my Pages

You can change the order that your Pages appear in your Page List.

1.  Click and hold on a Page to select it.
2.  Drag it up or down to change the Page order.
3.  Release to apply.

# Move Layers between Pages

You can move Layers between Pages. This is handy when you want to break up a large File. This also allows you to keep any Comments associated with those Layers intact.

1.  Select an Object, Frame or Group in the canvas or Layers Panel.
2.  Right-click to open the Context menu.
3.  Select **Move to Page** and then choose the **Page** you'd like to move it to ![](https://cdn.coiven.com/static/doc/file-ZMKIoYtn9L.png)
4.  We will move the layers to the same coordinates on the selected Page.

>**Note:** If you want to copy Prototype connections from the page, you need to have the **Prototype** Tab open. If you copy from the **Design** Tab, we won't copy any Prototype Connections.
