Files provide the canvas where you can arrange your layers and objects to create designs.

# Create a File in Drafts

Every Figma user will have their own **Drafts**. You can think of your Drafts like a sketchbook or notebook. It's a place where you can explore early ideas and experiment with different concepts that might not be ready to move into your team.

There are no limits to the number of files you can have in the Drafts space. To organize your files, move them into a project. Projects are only available in teams.

There are a few ways to create a new file in your Drafts:

*   Click the **+** button next to Drafts in the sidebar to create a new File in your Drafts![The top of the left sidebar of the file browser which shows Drafts and a plus sign to the right.](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5aa962fe2c7d3a2c4983093d/images/5dae4b272c7d3a7e9ae2d571/file-XrDgG0Kg8X.png)
*   Click the **New File** button in the File Browser![The top right corner of the file browser with a button labeled 'new file'.](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5aa962fe2c7d3a2c4983093d/images/5dae4b622c7d3a7e9ae2d573/file-FGFikFBDhA.png)

Figma encourages an open and collaborative design environment. It's never too early to share your ideas and collaborate with others.

*   Invite collaborators to your Personal Files
*   Move files from your Drafts into teams and projects

# Create a file in a team

If you are an **Editor** on a Team, you will be able to create Files that are shared with your Team.

1.  Open the Team Page in the File Browser
2.  Select the **project** you'd like to add the file to
3.  Click the **New File** button in the top-right corner of the toolbar.
