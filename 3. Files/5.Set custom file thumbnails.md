Every file will have a thumbnail that shows you a preview of a file's contents. Figma shows the thumbnail alongside the file in the File Browser.

You can choose create a custom thumbnail using any frame in your file. This is a great way to set expectations and communicate the file's contents.

Otherwise, Figma will base the file thumbnail on the contents of the first page in your file.

# Thumbnail dimensions

The exact dimensions of a file thumbnail will depend on the size of your display.

To ensure your custom thumbnail always displays optimally, we recommend setting the frame’s dimensions to **1920 x 960**.

Figma will always display anything within the **1600 x 960**“safe zone” of the frame.

If you use any other dimensions, Figma will scale your selected frame so that it fills the entire thumbnail.

>**Note**: Figma also uses these thumbnail dimensions for Community files. This is something to be mindful of when you publish a file to the [Figma Community](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040035974).

# Set a file's thumbnail

1.  Open the file in the Editor.
2.  Find the frame you would like to use as the thumbnail. We recommend setting the frame’s dimensions to **1920 x 960** for a proper fit, but Figma will scale the selected frame so it fills the thumbnail.
3.  Right-click on the frame in the canvas to open the Context Menu.
4.  Select **Set as Thumbnail** from the options:

5.  We will update your file's thumbnail. We will also display the custom thumbnail icon next to the Frame.
