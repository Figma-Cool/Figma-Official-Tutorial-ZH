**Files** are what we call documents in Figma. They contain the Canvas where you can arrange your layers and objects to create designs.

Within a File, you can create as many **Pages** as you need. Each Page offers its own Canvas, where you can explore and iterate on your designs.

# Page Structure

There are five levels of File structure and organization within Figma. Pages are the last level of structure.

Each Page offers its own Canvas, where you can explore and iterate on your designs. You can name each Page according to its purpose.

They are a great organizational tool, as they can be applied in so many ways.

1.  Organization ([Figma Organization](https://www.figma.com/organization/) only)
2.  Teams
3.  Projects
4.  Files
5.  **Pages**

You can use Pages to:

*   Iterate on different versions of a concept or idea
*   Break up designs by platform or device
*   Group designs by feature or product
*   Arrange Components and Styles into categories
*   Track each stage of the design process
*   Let engineers know what's ready for development
*   Present ideas or versions to collaborators
*   Build Atomic Libraries and Design Systems
*   Create different Prototyping flows for the same designs

# Using Pages

You can access **Pages** when you open a File in the **Editor**. You can find, view and navigate between Pages in the **Layers** Panel.

This allows you to:

*   Add New Pages
*   Duplicate Pages
*   Rename Pages
*   Delete Pages
*   Change the Order of Pages
*   Move Layers Between Pages
