When you delete a file, Figma will remove the file for all collaborators and send it to Deleted files. You can then access the deleted file via your Drafts.

# View deleted files

You can view any deleted files that you have/had access to. There are a few view options available for viewing and restoring deleted files.

    *   Created by **Anyone**: All deleted files, includes files you own and files from other collaborators.
    *   Created by **You** (default): Files you own.
    *   Created by **Others**: Files owned by other collaborators.
4.  Use the drop-down to **Sort** your results
    *   Date deleted (default)
    *   Alphabetical
    *   Date created

You can then choose to restore or duplicate the file. 

## Restore a file

If the project still exists—and you have access to it—you can restore the file to its original location. This restores the file for anyone who previously had access to it, at the time it was deleted.

This will also keep the [permissions](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039970673), [comments](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041068574), and [version history](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038006754) of the original file.

1.  Right-click on the file to open the file menu.
2.  Select **Restore** to restore to the File to its original location.

>**Tip!** Click the Show in Project link to view the file's in its location.

## Duplicate a file

If the project the file used to live in was deleted—or you no longer have access to that team or project —then you won't be able to restore the file to it's original location.

Instead, you can make a copy of that file in your Drafts. This won't include any of the [permissions](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039970673), [comments](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041068574), or [version history](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038006754) from the original file.

1.  Right-click on the file to open the file menu.
2.  Select **Duplicate to Drafts** to create a copy of the File in your **Drafts**. 
3.  Switch back to the **Drafts** tab to view and access the file.
